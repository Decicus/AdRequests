# Ad Requests
Ad Requests was a project originally written by [Heep123 in node.js, using RethinkDB](https://github.com/Heep123/AdRequests), but was eventually considered 'deprecated' due to RethinkDB shutting down.

This is a rewrite in PHP using Laravel 5.3, which is aimed to support all the past features and possibly more.

## Requirements
- [Laravel 5.3's requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/installation#server-requirements)
- [Composer for PHP](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [A Reddit app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)

## Setup
Coming soon&trade;

## Credits
- [Heep123](https://github.com/Heep123) for the original idea.
